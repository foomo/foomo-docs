# Context 

The ```context``` package in go provides a way for request-scoped values to be passed between all goroutines that are involved in handling a request.
Context also provides a way to set certain rules like how long a process can run before you automatically cancel it. A common way ```context``` is used is
for handling HTTP requests. The context package defines the Context type which has the following methods:
- ```Done()```
    * This returns a read-only channel which automatically closes when the context is canceled or when the context times out.
- ```Deadline()```
    * This returns both a deadline, which represents the time that the context will be canceled at or closed at, as well as a boolean that tells you 
    if a deadline is set for this context.
- ```Err()```
    * This returns an error explaining why the Done() channel was closed or nil if the Done() channel was not closed.
- ```Value(key interface{})```
    * This returns the value stored for the passed key or nil if the key is not present.
