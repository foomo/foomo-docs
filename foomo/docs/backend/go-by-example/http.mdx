# HTTP Client and Server

The HTTP protocol is used to communicate between Client and Server. The ```net/http``` package provides all methods needed to implement a client and 
a server and the most commonly used request methods.

The most commonly used request methods are:
- GET:
    * This method is used to request data from the server or specified source. Used for fetching data.
- POST:
    * This method is used to send a request with data in the body to a server. Used for creating data.
- PATCH:
    * This method is used to partially update an existing data entry.
- PUT:
    * This method is used to entirely update an existing data entry.

## HTTP Client
The HTTP Client consumes the API, it sends a request to the HTTP Server. The following code shows an example for all the commonly used HTTP requests.
```go

// GET Requests: Pass the URL to request the data from.
// Returns a response and an error.
resp, err := http.Get("https://foomo.org") 

// Post Requests: Pass the URL to post data to, specify the content type of the data, 
// and pass the body containing the data of the request.
// Returns a response and an error.
resp, err := http.Post("https://foomo.org", "application/json", body)

// PATCH Requests, specify it's a PATCH request, pass the URL to request, 
// and the body containing the data of the request.
// Returns a response and an error.
resp, err := http.NewRequest(http.MethodPatch, "https://foomo.org", body) 

// PUT Requests, specify it's a PUT request, pass the URL to request,
// and the body containing the data of the request.
// Returns a response and an error.
resp, err := http.NewRequest(http.MethodPut, "https://foomo.org", body) 

```

## HTTP Server
the HTTP Server accepts API calls from a Client. Handlers are a fundamental concept in the ```net/http``` package. 
They are your way of basically telling how a request is supposed to be handled. Handler functions always take a ResponseWriter and a pointer to a Request as argument:
```go
func myHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    ...
}
```
In the main function of your server you register all the handlers implemented and serve them on a specified port:

```go
func main () {

    http.HandleFunc("/myPage", myHandler) // specify the path and the handler function

    http.ListenAndServe(":8000", nil) // specify the port and the router, which is the default router in this case.
}
```
