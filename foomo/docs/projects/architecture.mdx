# Architecture overview

## backend services

When it comes to writing backend services we have decided for Go https://go.dev - let me list the main reasons why - Go is:

- simple and fun 
- fast when compiling
- fast at runtime
- friendly to your machines
- friendly to you as a programmer
- equipped with a top notch runtime
- extremely well balanced in its design as a language, that is highly consumable for humans and machines
- not about the features it has 
- about what has been left out
- easy to read
- sustainable


### Foomo projects supporting development with Go

- [keel](libraries/keel) - opinionated way to run services
- [gotsrpc](gotsrpc) - rpc framework / code generator
- [gograpple](utilities/gograpple) - human friendly way to debug go programs running in k8s
- [webgrapple](webgrapple) - a development proxy

## Frontends

- TypeScript https://www.typescriptlang.org/
- Next.js https://nextjs.org/
- Styled components https://styled-components.com/
- Storybook https://storybook.js.org/
