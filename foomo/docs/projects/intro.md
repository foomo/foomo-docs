# foomo project overview

___"Stuff we wrote, because nobody else wanted to"___

All foomo projects are available here https://github.com/foomo also see [architecture](architecture) 

We are using the best industry standards and only fill in our own bits, when necessary.

The foomo project maintains libraries, utilities and daemons, which power most projects at https://www.bestbytes.com

Projects running on the foomo stack typically are

- relatively large with hundreds of thousands of lines of code
- composed of dozens of microservices
- written / maintained by dozens of contributors
- using Go on the server side
- using Next.js / TypeScript on the client side
- running on k8s
- deeply integrated with a headless CMS
- built with a project specific frontend component set

Everything is loosely coupled, since we know, that the only constant is change.
