# Todos

There was a time, when building a todo app was the default demo, so here is one for you.:
## Go Service

Service interface defintion

```go reference title="server/services/wof/service.go" lines
https://github.com/foomo/gotsrpc-playground/blob/main/server/services/todos/service.go
```

Service implementation

```go reference title="server/services/helloworld/service.go"
https://github.com/foomo/gotsrpc-playground/blob/main/server/server/todos.go
```


## Next.js TypeScript client

```typescript reference title="client/pages/wheel-of-fortune.tsx"
https://github.com/foomo/gotsrpc-playground/blob/main/client/pages/todos.tsx
```
