# Playground

The playground is not for documentation - it is there to play with the service interface, the server implementation and the generated gotsrpc code.

## Go Service

Service interface defintion

```go reference title="server/services/playground/service.go" lines
https://github.com/foomo/gotsrpc-playground/blob/main/server/services/playground/service.go
```

Service implementation

```go reference title="server/services/playground/service.go"
https://github.com/foomo/gotsrpc-playground/blob/main/server/server/playground.go
```


## Next.js TypeScript client

```typescript reference title="client/pages/playground.tsx"
https://github.com/foomo/gotsrpc-playground/blob/main/client/pages/playground.tsx
```
