# Working remotely

Especially since the beginning of the corona pandemy working remotely has become a very important topic. The foomo team has extensive experience working remotely as we are a distributed team. 

Disclaimer: we are almost exclusively working in one timezone.

## Requirements

- fast and reliable internet connection
- a proper [workplace](../setup/workplace)

## The good parts

- no commute
- less distractions from team members

## The bad parts

- harder to separate between work and your private life
- less informal communication with teammates
- less human interaction

## When working from home

- make sure, that you have a routine, that still takes you to work
    - fixed working hours 
    - "go to work" and "leave work" even if you do not leave your home
    - if possible use a room, that is for work only
    - have clear rules for your family / roomates, when at work 
- when communication with teammates use video calls
- take time for your teammates and have a virtual coffee break with someone at least once a day
- invest half the time, that you save by not communiting to exercise
